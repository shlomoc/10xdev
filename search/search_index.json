Write the first draft the way you'd brief a new hire, then paste it verbatim. 2 Iterate ruthlessly &amp; read every model output The \"engineering\" part is the trial-and-error loop. Outputs teach you what the model misunderstood. After each run, ask \"what was misinterpreted?\"\u2014tweak, rerun, repeat. 3 Probe edge cases up front Prompts that only work on happy paths break in production. Feed the model empty input, malformed data, or \"no matches\" scenarios and specify how it should respond (e.g., unsure tag, fallback text, etc.). 4 Respect the model's intelligence\u2014don't baby it Modern models can digest papers and long context. Hiding complexity often makes them worse. Supply full docs, schemas or even research papers, then ask for the transformation you need. 5 Let the model critique your prompt It can spot ambiguities you missed. Add a pass: \"Ignore the task\u2014only list unclear/ambiguous parts of my instructions.\" Fix those. 6 Use example-based prompting strategically Too many similar examples overfit; illustrative, diverse ones teach the concept without constraining creativity. 1-3 varied examples &gt; dozens of near-identical ones. 7 Give the model an \"out\" Prevents forced, low-quality guesses on inputs outside spec. Add: \"If criteria aren't met, reply ONLY with 'UNSURE'\". 8 Test on tasks you think are barely possible Pushing boundaries reveals the techniques that matter and the limits worth coding around. Pick a hard case first, once it works, the easy ones will follow. 9 Use models to write (and refine) prompts High-bandwidth, meta-prompting speeds you up. Ask Claude to interview you about the task, then turn that Q&amp;A into the prompt skeleton. 10 Keep prompts tidy but don't obsess over typos Grammar helps humans read; models cope fine. Spend effort on conceptual clarity. Final pass: spell-check once, but prioritize meaning over polish. 11 Tell it what not to do, be specific about what to preserve during edits Negative constraints prevent unwanted changes and preserve important elements during modifications. Add explicit \"Don't change X\" or \"Preserve Y formatting\" instructions when editing existing content."},{"location":"reference/sparc-tutorial/","title":"SPARC Framework Tutorial","text":""},{"location":"reference/sparc-tutorial/#introduction-to-sparc","title":"Introduction to SPARC","text":"<p>The SPARC (Specification Pseudocode Architecture Refinement Completion) framework is a comprehensive approach to software development that leverages AI agents to streamline the development process.

Now, with Claude Code, you can even create subagents based on these prompts to help implement the process automatically. </p> <p>For example, you can create a backend python coding subagent to implement a feature, and a testing subagent to test the feature.  </p> <p>It's useful to have a verification system in place because the model often marks tasks as complete prematurely.  Create a separate test subagent that is responsible for checking the work done by the code agent to ensure that the results are reliable.  When the coding subagent says it is done, the test subagent will run the tests and let you know if they passed or failed.  If they failed, the coding subagent will be asked to fix the code and run the tests again.  This can be repeated until the tests pass.</p> <p>You can also use subagents to parallelize tasks that are independent of each other.  This can speed up the process.</p> <p>What are subagents?</p> <p>Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent:</p> <ul> <li>Has a specific purpose and expertise area</li> <li>Uses its own context window separate from the main conversation</li> <li>Can be configured with specific tools it's allowed to use</li> <li>Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior</li> </ul> <p>When Claude Code encounters a task that matches a subagent\u2019s expertise, it can delegate that task to the specialized subagent, which works independently and returns results.</p> <p>Excerpt copied from Anthropic documentation.</p> <p>The Anthropic help doc has instructions for creating subagents.  You can customize prompts like in the structured development processes below, and create your own agents.  </p> <p>Basic Example implementation from Ian Nuttall</p> <p>To customize agents for your existing code, you can use a prompt like this</p> <pre><code>There is a feature in Claude Code called subagents, the documentation is at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents.

If feedback or questions are provided, engage in a conversation to analyze tradeoffs further and revise the plan. Once revised, ask for approval again. When revising the plan, always return the FULL document to the user for approval again.\n4. Once approved, move onto creating the FULL UX/UI design document. This should include all the details above + the following:\n- Page by page breakdown of the UI/UX design requirements including robust user stories and acceptance criteria\n- Additional notes on technical considerations for each page as it relates to frontend development\n- This final document should also include the High-Level UI/UX Design, Sitemap and Detailed Component Hierarchy at the top\n5.

Start with the core project structure and essential configurations.\n2. Progress through database schema, server actions, and API routes.\n3. Move on to shared components and layouts.\n4. Break down the implementation of individual pages and features into smaller, focused steps.\n5. Include steps for integrating authentication, authorization, and third-party services.\n6.

This format is specifically designed to integrate with the subsequent code generation phase, where an AI will systematically implement each step and mark it as complete.
