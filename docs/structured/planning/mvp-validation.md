# MVP Validation Guide

## Purpose
Validate your MVP concept with real-world feedback before investing significant development resources.

## Input

* `market-opportunity.md` - Your market opportunity document
* `feature-priorities.md` - Your prioritized feature list

## Steps

### 1. Understand Common Validation Pitfalls

Most founders skip validation, assuming that if they need a solution, others will too. This leads to a common misconception:

* "It's a great idea, so people will pay"
* "The market is big enough for my product"

**Reality**: Most ideas fail due to a lack of actual demand.

### 2. Reframe Your Approach

Instead of asking, "Is my idea good?", reframe the question to:

* **"Who has this problem and how are they solving it today?"**

If no one is actively seeking a solution, the demand may be insufficient.

### 3. Research Existing Demand

To validate demand, consider these approaches:

* **Search Volume Check**: Use tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://business.google.com/us/ad-tools/keyword-planner/) or Ahrefs to see how many people are searching for the problem
* **Community Research**: Explore platforms like Reddit, X, and Discord forums to gauge discussions around the problem

### 4. Create a Validation Landing Page

Before coding, create a basic landing page that includes:

* A clear problem statement
* An explanation of how your product solves this problem
* An email signup form to measure interest

Drive traffic through:

* Social media posts and polls
* Targeted ads to potential users
* Community discussions

### 5. Secure Pre-Commitments

The best validation occurs when potential users are willing to pay before the product is built. Consider:

* Pre-selling to your network
* Offering early access discounts
* Running a paid waitlist with a small deposit

If people show hesitation to pay, it may signal a lack of interest.

### 6. Conduct User Interviews

Engage in direct conversations with potential users. Ask questions like:

* What is your biggest challenge related to this problem?
* Have you tried any solutions before?
* Would you pay for a tool that solves this?

If they express interest, follow up with questions regarding pricing and usage patterns.

### 7. Define Your Validated MVP Scope

If your validation efforts find positive signals, keep your MVP focused:

* Address one core pain point
* Cater to one specific user type

Construct only what is necessary for initial testing.

## Output

* Validated MVP concept with evidence of market demand
* List of potential early users or customers
* Refined understanding of user needs and priorities
