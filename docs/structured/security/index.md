# Security

## Purpose
Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

## Input

* Codebase

## Steps

### 1. Use the [Security Scan Prompt](./security-scan.md)
### 2. Implement recommended security improvements
### 3. Verify fixes with security testing

Tools like Claude Code also have built-in commands like /security-review that automatically scan for vulnerabilities.

## Output

* `security-audit.md` - Security assessment with identified vulnerabilities and fixes
* Secure codebase with implemented fixes

## Next Steps

- Proceed to [Deployment](../deployment/index.md) with your secure codebase and `security-audit.md`
