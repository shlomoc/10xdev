## Core Technologies

### 1. Next.js (App Router)

Next.js provides server-side rendering, API routes, and optimized performance. The App Router simplifies navigation and structure.

- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- Optimized performance

### 2. Authentication (Clerk)

Clerk handles secure user management with features that include:

- Secure user authentication
- Social login integrations
- Role-based access control

### 3. Database (Supabase)

Supabase offers powerful SQL capabilities coupled with real-time features.

- Real-time data synchronization
- SQL-based queries
- Built-in row-level security

### 4. Payments (Stripe)

Stripe integration facilitates seamless and secure transaction processing:

- Secure payment handling
- Subscription management
- Usage-based billing

### 5. UI & Styling (Tailwind CSS)

Tailwind CSS provides a flexible, responsive styling solution:

- Responsive and adaptive layouts
- Customizable component library
- Dark/light mode support

### 6. UI Components (Shadcn/UI)

Pre-designed UI components for fast and consistent UI development.

### 7. Deployment (Vercel)

Reliable, scalable hosting optimized specifically for Next.js applications.

### 8. Email (Resend)

Effective email communication solutions integrated seamlessly into the stack.

## Additional Features

### Responsive Design

Ensure optimal performance and user experience on all devices:

- Mobile-first approach
- Cross-device compatibility
- Adaptive layouts

## Project Structure

A clear, organized project structure facilitates ease of maintenance and scalability.  Here is one example:

```
project/
├── documentation/        # Generated documentation
├── public/               # Static assets
├── src/                  # Source code root
│   ├── app/              # Next.js app router pages
│   ├── components/       # React components
│   ├── hooks/            # Integration hooks
│   ├── lib/              # Library functions
│   ├── styles/           # Global styles
│   ├── supabase/         # Supabase functions
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── tests/                # Test suites
│   ├── integration/      # Integration tests
│   └── unit/             # Unit tests
```

(If you are using next.js template, another approach is to take a screenshot of the folders it generates in Visual Studio to give to Cursor IDE.)
