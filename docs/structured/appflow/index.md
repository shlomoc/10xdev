Define the structure, navigation, and flow of your application.

## Input
* `prd.md` from previous step
* `tech-stack.md` from previous step

## Inspiration

Some curated sites for inspiration:

* [curated.design](https://www.curated.design/) Top-notch website designs.
* [godly.website](https://godly.website/) Animated, experimental sites.
* [mobbin](https://mobbin.com) Mobile UI screenshots from popular apps.

Screenshot them for upload.

## Steps

### 1. Use the [Sitemap Design Doc prompt](./sitemap-design-doc.md)
### 2. Follow the [UI Prototype Guide](./ui-prototype.md)

## Output
* `app-sitemap.md` - Document outlining your application's structure and navigation
* Wireframes or page images from UI prototyping

Alternatively, use [stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/home) to generate high-quality user interfaces for mobile and web apps and easily export them to Figma, or directly access the frontend code.  

[superdesign.dev](https://www.superdesign.dev/) is an open source project to try designs using parallel agents (created with Taskmaster)

## Next Steps
* Proceed to [Design Spec](../design/index.md) using your `prd.md`, `tech-stack.md`, and `app-sitemap.md` as input
