## Purpose
Establishes your design system and visual language for consistent UI/UX implementation.

## Input
* `project-prd.md` from previous step
* `app-sitemap.md` from previous step

## Steps

### 1. UI Concept Exploration
```md
Given the features below, suggest multiple UI approaches (e.g., minimalistic, colorful, modern). Briefly describe the layouts for each.

Features:
`INSERT YOUR FEATURES`

Please provide:
- 3-4 distinct visual approaches
- Layout descriptions for key pages
- Pros and cons of each approach
- Recommended approach based on target users
```

### 2. Wireframe Generation
Use a tool like [UX Pilot](https://uxpilot.ai/) to generate wireframes based on your layout descriptions. This allows for the quick creation of various screens.

```md
Generate wireframes for the homepage based on this description:

`Insert UI description`

Consider:
- Layout structure
- Component placement
- Navigation elements
- Key user interactions
- Responsive design considerations
```

## Output
* Wireframes or page images

## Optional
* UI Prototype Development

Utilize [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) to create a functional UI prototype from your wireframes.

```md
Using this wireframe: `Insert image`, create the UI. Keep it minimalistic.

Please include:
- Component specifications

- Interactive elements
```

You can also use [SnapPrompt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-674c835b12b48191bc59fd0f3953d345-snapprompt) to turn a screenshot into ready-to-use prompt to recreate the UI.


## Next Steps
* Proceed to [Design Spec](../design/index.md) using your `project-prd.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `app-sitemap.md` and wireframes as input
