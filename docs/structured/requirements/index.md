# Requirements

## Purpose
Establish clear project requirements and specifications.

## Input
- `market-opportunity.md` from previous step
- `feature-priorities.md` from previous step

## Here is basically what you need to define:

1. Introduction: Explain the problem you’re solving and the vision for the product. This sets the context for everyone involved.

2. Objectives & Goals: Highlight the main outcomes the product should achieve. What’s the core purpose?

3. Target Users & Roles: Identify who will use the product (e.g., clients, admins) and what actions they need to perform.

4. Core Features for MVP: List the must-have features to deliver value quickly and validate the product.

5. Future Scope: Outline features that can be added later. This helps clients think beyond the MVP without overloading the first phase.

6. User Journey: Map out how users interact with the product step by step. Cover all roles for complete clarity.

7. Tech Stack: Define the tools, frameworks, and APIs you’ll use to build the product.

## Steps

### 1. Launch [ChatPRD](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-G5diVh12v-chatprd-ai-for-product-managers)
### 2. Alternatively, use a custom mode in Cursor like [PRD mode](https://playbooks.com/modes/prd)  
### 3. You can also use [Codeguide](https://www.codeguide.dev/) for help in creating detailed documentation for your project

## Output
- `prd.md` - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document containing:
    - App overview
    - User flows
    - Tech stack & APIs
    - Core features
    - In-scope vs. out-of-scope items

## Next Steps
- Proceed to [Tech Stack](../tech-stack/index.md) and [App Flow](../appflow/index.md) using your `prd.md` as input
