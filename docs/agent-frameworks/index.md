# Agent Frameworks

A guide to frameworks and platforms for building AI agents that can perform complex, multi-step tasks and coordinate with other agents.

## Available Frameworks

### A2A (Agent to Agent)
An open protocol from Google that enables AI agents to communicate and collaborate regardless of their platform or creator.

### LangGraph
LangChain's framework for building, deploying and managing complex generative AI agent workflows with observability tools.

### CrewAI
A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents to work together as a crew on complex tasks.

### Mastra
A modern framework for building AI agents with TypeScript, built-in integrations and workflow management.

### [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) - Lightweight Python framework for building multi-agent workflows
