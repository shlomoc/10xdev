# AI Coding Tools

A comprehensive guide to AI-powered development tools that can accelerate your coding workflow and boost productivity.

## AI Development Tools Categories

### Cloud AI IDEs
Full-featured development environments that run in the cloud with AI capabilities and deployment built-in.

### VS Code Forks  
Enhanced versions of Visual Studio Code with advanced AI features and integrations.

### IDE Plugins
Extensions and plugins that add AI capabilities to existing development environments.

### AI Agents
Autonomous coding assistants and command-line tools that can perform complex development tasks.

Explore each category to find the right AI coding tools for your development workflow and project needs.

## How to choose

Use the category pages to reflect on your needs:

- Want fast MVP deployment? → Cloud-Based Platforms (Lovable, Google AI Studio, Bolt.new, Replit)
- Want developer IDEs with AI capabilities? → VS Code Forks (Cursor AI, Windsurf)
- Prefer open source where you pay by model token usage? → IDE Plugins (Cline, Roo Code)  
- Need automation and branching workflows? → AI Agents & CLI Tools (Claude Code, Google Jules, OpenAI Codex)

## Level up by using multiple tools

For example, consider this coding setup:
VS Code with Codex 5.2 on the left, Claude Code Opus 4.5 on the right

1. Start building with Claude Code in plan mode
2. Copy and paste every plan into Codex. Validate the plan. If they have any critical feedback, give it back to CC
3. Every change either agent makes, ask the other agent to review it
4. When one agent submits a PR, use the other agent to review it

Not only will you produce better apps, you'll have fun just feeling like you're managing a team of engineers.
