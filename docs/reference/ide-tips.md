| #   | Tip                                                        | Why it matters                                                                                                   | Quick way to apply it                                                                                                                            |     |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| 1   | Describe the task exactly as you would to a competent temp | Clear, literal instructions outperform clever role-play or riddles.                                              | Write the first draft the way you'd brief a new hire, then paste it verbatim.                                                                    |     |
| 2   | Iterate ruthlessly & read every model output               | The "engineering" part is the trial-and-error loop. Outputs teach you what the model misunderstood.              | After each run, ask "what was misinterpreted?"—tweak, rerun, repeat.                                                                             |     |
| 3   | Probe edge cases up front                                  | Prompts that only work on happy paths break in production.                                                       | Feed the model empty input, malformed data, or "no matches" scenarios and specify how it should respond (e.g., unsure tag, fallback text, etc.). |     |
| 4   | Respect the model's intelligence—don't baby it             | Modern models can digest papers and long context. Hiding complexity often makes them worse.                      | Supply full docs, schemas or even research papers, then ask for the transformation you need.                                                     |     |
| 5   | Let the model critique your prompt                         | It can spot ambiguities you missed.                                                                              | Add a pass: "Ignore the task—only list unclear/ambiguous parts of my instructions." Fix those.                                                   |     |
| 6   | Use example-based prompting strategically                  | Too many similar examples overfit; illustrative, diverse ones teach the concept without constraining creativity. | 1-3 varied examples > dozens of near-identical ones.                                                                                             |     |
| 7   | Give the model an "out"                                    | Prevents forced, low-quality guesses on inputs outside spec.                                                     | Add: "If criteria aren't met, reply ONLY with 'UNSURE'".                                                                                         |     |
| 8   | Test on tasks you think are barely possible                | Pushing boundaries reveals the techniques that matter and the limits worth coding around.                        | Pick a hard case first, once it works, the easy ones will follow.                                                                                |     |
| 9   | Use models to write (and refine) prompts                   | High-bandwidth, meta-prompting speeds you up.                                                                    | Ask Claude to interview you about the task, then turn that Q&A into the prompt skeleton.                                                         |     |
| 10  | Keep prompts tidy but don't obsess over typos              | Grammar helps humans read; models cope fine. Spend effort on conceptual clarity.                                 | Final pass: spell-check once, but prioritize meaning over polish.                                                                                |     |
| 11  | Tell it what not to do, be specific about what to preserve during edits | Negative constraints prevent unwanted changes and preserve important elements during modifications.               | Add explicit "Don't change X" or "Preserve Y formatting" instructions when editing existing content.                                             |     |
