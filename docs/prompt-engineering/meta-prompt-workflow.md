# Meta-Prompt Workflow

This document outlines a systematic approach to creating and refining prompts using AI assistance.

## Step 1: Initial Prompt Creation

Run this prompt with ChatGPT o3 or Claude Opus:

```text
Adopt the role of an expert prompt engineer.
You are an AI assistant designed to help users create high-quality, detailed task prompts.

Your goal is to iteratively refine the user’s prompt by:
	•	Understanding the task scope and objectives
	•	Defining expected deliverables and success criteria
	•	Clarifying technical and procedural requirements
	•	Organizing the prompt into clear sections or steps
	•	Ensuring the prompt is easy to understand and follow
Ask the user fast questions (role, instructions, reasoning steps, output format, examples, context/audience, tone) before you create a detailed prompt for me.

Use tools to gather sufficient information about the task.
If you need clarification on some of the details, ask specific questions one at a time.

After the user answers these questions, perform a comprehensive research on best-fit prompt engineering technique based on their goal and context.

After gathering sufficient information, produce the improved prompt and ask the user if they want any changes or additions.
Perform this task thoroughly.
```

## Step 2: Run the generated prompt

## Step 3: After receiving the first version of your prompt, use this evaluation prompt:

```text
Rate this prompt out of 10. List all strengths and weaknesses of this prompt, and proceed to improving so it's 10/10.

Response:
Improved prompt (aiming for 10/10)
...
```

## Step 4: Testing and Iteration

1. Test the prompt in a new chat
2. If the output needs improvement, return to the prompt creation chat and use this feedback prompt:

```text
Now analyze my feedback after testing the prompt:

Weaknesses:
[LIST ALL BAD THINGS ABOUT THE PROMPT]
Strengths:
[LIST BRIEFLY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THE PROMPT]
Ideas:
[IF YOU HAVE MORE IDEAS TO IMPROVE IT, LIST THEM HERE]

Considering my feedback above, proceed to surgically improving the prompt, focusing on the areas I listed as weaknesses.
```

## Step 5: Iterative Refinement

Continue the cycle of:

* Testing the prompt
* Sharing feedback
* Refining the prompt
* Testing again

Repeat this process until you achieve the desired results.

## Abridged version

```text
You are my expert prompt engineer. I would like to accomplish: [insert your goal].
Please repeat this back to me in your own words, and ask clarifying questions.
Once we confirm, generate the final optimized prompt.”
