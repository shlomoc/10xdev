Example:
I want to create a web app that let’s people create multiple ad variants from one ad creative image using AI.

This should work by letting the user upload one ad image file, then sending the image to ChatGPT and using the prompt ‘generate 10 variants of this image’ to generate 10 more images. The user would then be asked to pay a one off fee or subscribe, and then be able to download the images.

I want this app to be called ‘More Variants’

The type of customer I am targeting is marketing managers who struggle to create lots of different ad variants so they can get ad variants much quicker and not have to wait for designers

I want my app to look and feel fun and playful like notes on a sketchpad or a whiteboard with sticky notes like FigJam or Miro

I want to create a landing page with a hero section, a how it works section, testimonials section, pricing section, and frequently asked questions.

The user should be able to start using the app by uploading their first ad image file in the hero section and clicking a button underneath named ‘create ad variants’

When the user clicks ‘create ad variants’ they should then be taken to a page which asks them to sign up using Google sign in or using an email and password to get their ad variants. Once they sign up, they should then be taken to a pricing screen to choose their plan. After choosing their plan, they should pay via Stripe, and then be taken to a page which shows a loading state whilst the image file the user uploaded is sent to ChatGPT to get their 10 ad variants. After that, the ad variants created by ChatGPT should be shown on the page and in the user’s account.

The user should also be able to save ad variants to their account, edit their account details, and also be able to manage their subscription (link to stripe) from their account page.

There should be 2 payment options for users. A one-off payment of $19 that lets users get ad variants once, and a subscription option of $9/month that lets users get unlimited ad variants and save ad variants to their account.
